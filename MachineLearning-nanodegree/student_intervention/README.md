# Build a Student Intervention System

Supervised Learning Project

## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and iPython/Jupyter Notebook.

## Code

Template code is provided in the notebook `student_intervention.ipynb`.

To open it, go to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` and start the notebook server:

```ipython notebook```

OR:

```jupyter notebook```

This should open a web browser to the server's dashboard (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8888`). Click on the appropriate notebook (`.ipynb`) to open it, and follow the instructions.

## Run

To run a code cell in the notebook, hit `Shift+Enter`. Any output will be displayed below the corresponding cell.

You can also add/edit markdown text cells and render them using `Shift+Enter`.
