    "#Analyzing Model Performance\n",
    "In this third section of the project, you'll take a look at several models' learning and testing error rates on various subsets of training data. Additionally, you'll investigate one particular algorithm with an increasing `max_depth` parameter on the full training set to observe how model complexity affects learning and testing errors. Graphing your model's performance based on varying criteria can be beneficial in the analysis process, such as visualizing behavior that may not have been apparent from the results alone."

In the max_depth 1 set, we initially see that bias/variance on test and train is high, and as the number of data points increases we continue to see bias and variance in the train set. At max_depth 1, the model is not a good representation of the data. When we look at the max_depth 10, we see that the total error drops significantly faster, and we see variance decrease  as the number of data points increases.This means that as max_depth increases we need more data for the model to reach peak performance, but that if this data is available, the model can be accurate."

Realizing this was incorrect, I took another look at the scorer, specifically modifying the make_scorer parameter, such that it worked correctly for MSE, by altering the greater_is_better parameter to False. This changed the result to match my intuition that a larger max_depth is better "

Additionally, the data set may be too small to use for general prediction of price trends. Using this model, we may be able to reliably make a prediction with accuracy equal to our value +/- the standard deviation calculated. "
